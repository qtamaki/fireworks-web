# The Synchronized Draggable BOX Scala Servlet

This is a very simple servlet meant to demonstrate jetty websocket application in scala.
This project is using sbt, jetty, jetty-websocket, jquery and jquery ui library.

To run this project, in sbt run:

    cd websocket-jetty-scala
    sbt
    container:start

Then you can see "The Synchronized Draggable BOX" at http://localhost:8080/ .

And you can see synchronized moving dragging box any browsers and any machines.

Thanks.
